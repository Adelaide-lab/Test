1.If we take the bottom 4-bit number as the biggest base, then five decimal numbers are 9 9 15 9 6.And hexadecimal numbers are 9 9 F 9 6.

2.
  1 ---> 0 0 0 1
  1 ---> 0 0 0 1
  9 ---> 1 0 0 1
  9 ---> 1 0 0 1
  6 ---> 0 1 1 0. 

  I have no idea what this is exactly, but it does like a capital j.
	
  0x:
  F ---> 1 1 1 1
  8 ---> 1 0 0 0
  F ---> 1 1 1 1
  8 ---> 1 0 0 0
  8 ---> 1 0 0 0

  I thinks it's a capital f.

3.
  As for 'B'
  5 numbers is not enough.
  But 'N' may be Okay.
